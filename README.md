# Environmental-Impact-of-Food-Production-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing the environmental impact of food production, with an emphasis on key metrics such as carbon emissions, water usage, land use, and biodiversity loss.


### Business Understanding
This step defines the goals and key questions of the project.

üìå Project Objectives
The goal of this project is to assess the environmental impact of food production at both macro and micro levels and propose data-driven insights to mitigate the negative effects of food production on the environment. This will help policymakers, environmentalists, food producers, and consumers make more informed decisions that support sustainability.

1. Assess the environmental impact of different food products based on:

* Carbon emissions

* Water usage

* Land use

* Biodiversity loss

2. Identify high-impact vs. low-impact foods.

3. Provide data-driven recommendations for sustainable food production.

üìå Analytical Questions

1. Which food products have the highest and lowest carbon emissions?

2. How do plant-based vs. animal-based foods compare in environmental impact?

3. What is the correlation between land use, water use, and emissions?

4. Which food production stage (farm, transport, packaging, retail) contributes most to emissions?

5. How do different food categories (cereals, dairy, meat, vegetables) impact the environment?

6. What are the top contributors to eutrophication (water pollution)?

7. Can we group foods based on their environmental impact using clustering?

üöÄ 

üìå Hypothesis Testing

H‚ÇÄ (Null Hypothesis): There is no significant difference in environmental impact between plant-based and animal-based foods.

H‚ÇÅ (Alternative Hypothesis): Animal-based foods have a significantly higher environmental impact than plant-based foods.

## Hypothesis Testing Summary

| Metric           | U-statistic | p-value  | Result                    |
|-----------------|------------|----------|---------------------------|
| Total Emissions | 27.0000     | 1.0000   | No significant difference |
| Total Water Use | 117.0000    | 0.9185   | No significant difference |
| Total Land Use  | 95.0000     | 0.9787   | No significant difference |


### Data Understanding
The dataset includes 43 food products and 23 features related to environmental impacts (such as land use, water use, and carbon footprint across production stages).

Key features:

* Greenhouse gas emissions across production stages (land use change, animal feed, transport, packaging, etc.).

* Eutrophication impact (nutrient runoff affecting water bodies).

* Water and land usage metrics.
